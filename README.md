# React workshop

This is a workshop for people who want to start using React as the frontend framework (or view library, really!) of choice.


## Requirements

- Node.js 14+
- Npm 8+

To get started, clone this repository locally and run:

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the necessary dependencies.


## Getting started

The material for this workshop is available in the form of slides here: [fth.link/react-slides](https://fth.link/react-slides).

If you want to run a particular example, go to the specific example folder and run `npm run dev`.

For example, to run the `08-loading-data` example:

```bash
cd 08-loading-data
npm run dev

Then you should be able to see the application running on [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/).
